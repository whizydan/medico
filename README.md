# Medico üíä
Medify is a medical android app which deals and solves issues of both patients and doctors. 

## Application Install

***You can Install and test latest Medify app from the release section üëá***


# Our Idea üí°
- Medify is an Android application that not only solves the issue of the patients as users, but also solves the problems of the doctors as well.

- The app offers users to book an appointment with the doctor that is registered in the app already.

- The waiting queue is sorted according to the priority and not ‚ÄòFirst Come First Serve‚Äô which allows all the patients to get equal priority.

- The users can upload their prescription which only keeps the latest upload which the doctor can check.

- The users can monitor their health data which is shown in a chart of last 5 data from their report.

# App Features üéØ

- <b>Appointment Booking:</b> The user can search doctors by their name, phone or email to book an appointment.
The users have to answer some questions regarding their issue, this way the appointment is booked.
- <b>Appointment Sorting:</b> an algorithm that analyses the user data, makes some calculation and sorts the patient queue according to the priority. 
This way every patient gets priority equally.
- <b>Prescription:</b> The user uploads their latest prescription in the app, so when booked an appointment, the doctor can check their recent 
prescription and hence carrying prescription is not required.
- <b>Statistics:</b> The user can add and monitor their past 5 data of health reports which is displayed using charts.
- <b>Instant UPI:</b> the Doctor can add their fee details and the app generates a QR Code itself.
- <b>Appointment / Patient Queue List:</b> The users can check their appointment list of all doctors to which they booked appointment. 
The patient queue is a list that is sorted using an  algorithm and displayed.
